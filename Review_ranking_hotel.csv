"23042";"225 Route 28";"West Yarmouth";"US";"Bayside Resort Hotel";"Yarmouth";2011-05-12;"I brought my wife and two young children for an Easter weekend getaway. I was not aware that a block of rooms nearby were taken by a group that wanted to get drunk and party all night. We tried to ignore the noise but after midnight, my wife asked the group to keep the noise down. They got louder. After two more tries, we contacted the front desk. The night manager stopped by for about a minute asking the group to quiet down. As soon as he left, the drunken mob was angry at us and star...view moreted slamming into our door. When my wife opened the door to complain, they started to push her around. As soon as I stepped out of the door to help my wife, I was beaten by this drunken mob as my children in the room were terrified. My eye glasses were punched into my face causing me to bleed profusely. I was beaten and kicked as I lay on the hallway floor. My wife also has bruises all over her body. A couple across the hall called the police, but the damage was already done. When the police arrived, the attackers scattered. Some were in rooms on our floor while others were not even guests of the hotel. There are no cameras, no security and a night manager who would rather not get involved. The management told me that there was nothing that they can do because they have no way of knowing who was at fault. Unbelievable. My face is cut up, my wife is bruised and my children are traumatized. Good place if you want to party all night long. Bad place to bring a family.

I booked online very late the night before and was shocked to get such a great deal. As it turns out, there was an error in the price listing. The hotel honored the rate and the customer service was outstanding. I wasn't able to take advantage of most of the amenities, so I can't speak to the condition of the pool/whirlpool or continental breakfast. The room was very clean and had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. (There's a 24-hour Walmart located next door so I was able to pick up any overnight items I needed there.) The small fridge in the room made a loud noise, but I was able to quiet it by sliding a thick piece of cardboard under one of the corners. My only criticism is that the mattress was much too firm for MY personal preference. (I have chronic lower back pain and own a Sleep Number bed, which I keep between 35 and 45 on a scale of 1-100, with 100 being maximum firmness.)

Unfortunately my car window was smashed during the night property was stolen. Mgmt alerted me to the break in and was polite and accommodating when asked for assistance. However I have to say that management seemed almost disturbingly unconcerned. It took 3 attempts to get the police dept to respond. The 1st officer was sympathetic but explained there was nothing they could do. The 2nd officer was very short tempered and said that they simply did not have time to deal with minor crimes. The 3rd officer, who actually did come to the hotel, told me that I should not stay anywhere at that particular interchange due to the very high crime rate and that I should leave the area as soon as possible. I could not drive the car with my young son because of the amount of glass everywhere in the car. Because of a string of mishaps the repair company was not able to finish the repair until nearly 8:00pm. This made for a long night of driving home after a very stressful day. Hotel staff was adamant that there was not room for me to stay an additional night and did not allow me to stay in our room past 3:00pm. We wound up camping out in the lobby. Hotel mgmt seemed to indicate that a room might be available. To be perfectly honest I could not stay another night at the hotel and expect to get any sleep.

I don't really tolerate hair in a clean hotel room, but I threw it away and let it go. When I was helping my daughter wash her hands soon after, the soap dispenser on the wall fell, and then I could tell the bathroom counter and sink were not cleaned, and there was more hair in the sink. The kids were excited to swim, so we ignored this mess and went to the pool. The pool was fine, but the hot tub was very murky. After swimming, we went back to the room and when I pulled the covers down in the bed, there were 2 more hairs. It was late, and we were tired, so I cleaned them up. In the morning, when I opened the shower curtain to take a shower, there was hair hanging from the shower faucet, and then from the towels! I couldn't handle anymore grossness, and we packed up and left. No one in my family got ready that morning, and there was no one one at the front desk to talk to.

This year, they did not give me the balcony room that I PREPAID for, and waited until check-in to tell me, so I had no options but to accept a room without one. AND, they did NOT offer any kind of compensation for that, nor did they ever apologize. Further, last year this hotel experienced a significant check-in process problem that kept me and my two toddlers without a room until 8pm (this also impacted about 100 guests). Within this, they issued me keys to two OCCUPIED rooms, so we walked in on people - terribly embarrassing, inconvenient, and UNSAFE. Again, no apologies or compensation offered. I wrote to the GM about this, and he begrudgingly comped one of our nights. Other issues - in general, the service is slow, uncoordinated, and unhelpful. People seem very polite but when it comes to accommodating you or problem solving, they aren't capable. It's like they aren't given the tools to do their jobs well and/or no one has really trained them - just a halfway (that's the nice term) approach to service is all you will see from the front desk and most other staff (except the spa which tends to be pretty awesome). Bottom line . . . the lake scenery and the spa are AMAZING. So, if you can dramatically lower your expectations about the hotel service level, you'll be fine.

I caught it and confirmed in an online image search that it was indeed a bedbug. We tore up the covers and found another. Out of curiosity, we looked at the other bed in the room and didn't see any, but we did notice it was wrapped in a mattress cover that our bed didn't have...perhaps evidence that someone knew there was a problem (which obviously wasn't eradicated) We'd heard bedbug infestation horror stories so we packed everything up, called the night manager to tell her we would be seeking alternate accommodations and dropped our key in the slot. The night manager advised us to talk to another manager in the morning. The next morning my husband talked to the manager and although she was reluctant to give us a complete refund (citing Expedia fees, etc), she did agree and we received a refund.

When we booked the hotel it said it was the last one available, meaning that all their other rooms were taken. For a hotel that claims to be at full capacity and thus possibly doing well financially, the quality of their rooms is disgusting. We walked into the room and it instantly smelled of cigarette. Nowhere on our booking did it say this was a smoking room. The bedroom furniture was all written on with permanent marker by someone named Chula, who was asking for money. The smoke detectors were broken and hanging from the wall. Some of the outlets you could tell had burned out because they were brown from the outside (we didn't use them.) The bathroom door had a hole in it, there was no toilet paper, or complimentary  soaps. The shower did not work!! Only the bottom part of the shower worked so you had to kneel inside the tub to get any water. The chairs had the cushions fall out.

In the morning there was a homeless person walking through the hallways and going through the garbage. The decor was old and worn (holes in the draperies), but it appeared passably clean. 2 soups, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, a make-up remover pacakge, Q-tips, and cotton balls were all provided. Breakfast was OK. Lots of pre-packaged food, but the eggs they advertised were obviously powdered--they were in the shape of squares! Cereal, muffins, bread, toaster, no peanut butter, boiled eggs, cheese slices (american), hot sausage and a waffle maker. So that was OK. At 167 with tax it's one of the cheaper places in Sunnyvale and if you're just there for the night because you have to go to family court down the street, it's OK.

The surrounding areas which are in easy walking distance had a great choice of bars and restaurant's and it was nice to walk out every evening to wander round.

The evening entertainment was quite good and the kids loved it. But I'm not sure I would have liked to be staying right next to it as it went on quite late and if you were trying to sleep a child it would be impossible.

I understand the whole resort/cleaning fee, and I do not mind to pay 130 if I am informed in advanced. I book hotels very frequent and I understand the resort fee usually bases on daily. If not, the property will inform the slum sum amount before customer decide to book or not. At castle kona reef, cleaning happens once a week, so we do not get room cleaning during our stay.

Buy a ticket for airport shuttle (6 Euro) and 1-way bus ticket (1.3 Euro) to Garibaldi Hotel. You can buy tickets at airport public transport info counter. Airport shuttle no 15 stops at Train Station. Along the same road but going in the other direction, you can hop onto public bus no 2 to get to Garibaldi Hotel. Location is excellent as public bus no. 2 stops just outside hotel. This bus took us to Venice Piazalle Roma bus stop in about 20 minutes. There is a grocery store nearby and many eateries. Hotel is run by brother and sister team and they are very friendly. Continental Breakfast spread is wholesome with a good variety, including boiled eggs. One problem for those who cannot climb stairs is that there is no lift. Still Mr Luigi and his assistant helped us to carry our luggage up the stairs. We stayed 4 nights at the hotel before joining the Mediterranean cruise. We came back for another night after the cruise. Though the vicinity is generally safe, there are pickpockets at the Wed and Fri morning market at town square nearby-so one must be careful.

I was told most guests prefer to do this themselves because they do not want strangers in their room. Really I'm on vacation - clearly that wasn't something that was on my must do list. I asked about changing rooms and was told they were sold out. I'm not sure that was truthful since the parking lot was clearly not full. With 3 children and it being 10pm at this point, finding a new hotel wasn't really an option. After being handed a plunger and extra towels I unclogged my own toilet and then proceeded to act as Certfied Plumber two more times that night and the next morning. Breakfast the next morning was the one positive of this stay. I never spoke to the manager - when I went to the desk in the morning to voice my concerns I was told she was on a conference call.

The room had up-to-date comforters and drapes with a more modern look. But the physical structure of the room was old. The drywall had lumpy patches, the bathroom looked old and well worn and the size was on the small size like that of a 1970s hotel which it probably was. The air conditioner had an intense musty smell and was probably the original A/C from when the hotel was built. The bathroom had quite a bit of hair on the floor and the grout was dirty everywhere. On the plus side, the sheets were comfortable, good pillows and the A/C cooled the room real well. The breakfast buffet had items, such as, waffles, boiled eggs, muffins, breads, cereal, oatmeal and yogurt, along with coffee, milk, apple and orange juice. And the price was much better than the neighboring hotels.";"So-so hotel at a good price.";"Chris";" hotel definitely just average room date comforter drape much modern look physical structure room old drywall lumpy patch bathroom look old good wear size small size like s hotel probably air conditioner intense musty smell probably original c hotel build bathroom quite bite hair floor grout dirty everywhere plus side sheet comfortable good pillow c cool room real good breakfast buffet item waffle boil egg muffin bread cereal oatmeal yogurt along coffee milk apple orange juice price much good neighbor hotel hotel good price";"text1303";11;0;"positive";0,549463871146136;0;"positive";"same";0,549463871146136;"5"
